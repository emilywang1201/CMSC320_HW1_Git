Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the service industry to optimize a customer's travel experience. For example, the ratings the customer gives out could be utilized to
better recommend restaurants based on their preferences. The same could be said for hotels, entertainment, and many other things. Data science could also be used in the medicine.
There are vast amounts of health data on patients with different conditions. This data could be analyzed to assess trends in health that could correspond to a given condition or
illness. This is actually a field that I am very interested in since I want to go into medicine. I currently work in a cancer research lab and would love to use data analytics and
science to comb through large amounts of biological data to see if there are any patterns going unnoticed. I hope that this class will prepare me to pursue a possible future career
in this field.
