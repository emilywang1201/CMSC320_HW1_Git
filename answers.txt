Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a tool that aids in code management and documentation. This is especially useful when working in team settings (many people making changes indepent of each other)
or when working with complicated projects. Git's documentation means that parsing through code changes and reverting to old versions of code becomes much easier. Additionally, each
team member can see exactly what and why a change was made by another member. Of course, there is always a caveat in that these changes must be committed to Git in order to view
them and good documentation comments are needed for others to understand the logic behind the changes.
